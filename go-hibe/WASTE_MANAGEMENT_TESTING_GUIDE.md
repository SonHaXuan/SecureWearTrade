# Smart Waste Management Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive testing documentation for the HIBE key delegation and revocation system in a **Smart City Waste Management** context.

## Quick Start

### Run the Complete Test Suite

```bash
cd go-hibe
./test_waste_management_scenarios.sh
```

### What Gets Tested

The test suite covers **10 real-world waste management scenarios**:

#### Delegation Scenarios (7 tests)
1. **Collection Vehicle Route Optimization** - Driver accessing bin data for route planning
2. **Emergency Overflow Response** - Emergency team accessing overflowing bin
3. **Recycling Center Processing** - Processing batch data sharing
4. **Transfer Station Data Sharing** - E-waste batch transfer to processing plant
5. **Facility Inspection** - Compliance inspector accessing facility operations
6. **Environmental Monitoring** - Continuous emissions monitoring
7. **IoT Sensor Data** - Real-time predictive maintenance

#### Revocation Scenarios (3 tests)
1. **Driver Departure** - Employee leaving company
2. **Security Breach** - Emergency revocation response
3. **Compliance Audit** - Temporary access suspension

```

## Extending Tests

### Add New Scenario

1. **Define in `waste_management_test_scenarios.md`**
2. **Create test function in script:**
```bash
test_my_scenario() {
    print_scenario "My New Scenario"
    # ... test implementation
}
```
3. **Call from main execution**
4. **Update documentation**

### Modify Test Data

Edit variables at top of script:
```bash
HIERARCHY="smart-city-waste"
CITY_ID="city-metro"
# Add new entities, URIs, etc.
```

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitLab CI Example
```yaml
test:waste-management:
  script:
    - cd go-hibe
    - go build
    - ./hibe-api &
    - sleep 5
    - ./test_waste_management_scenarios.sh
  artifacts:

## Compliance Documentation

### Environmental Compliance

The test suite validates:
- ✅ **Emissions Monitoring**: Real-time tracking, threshold alerts
- ✅ **Data Protection**: Secure access controls, audit logs
- ✅ **Regulatory Compliance**: Environmental standards adherence
- ✅ **Citizen Rights**: Consent management, data access

### Audit Trail

Every test generates audit trail:
- Who accessed data
- When access occurred
- What data was accessed
- Why access was granted
- When revocation occurred

## Real-World Deployment

Before production deployment:

1. **Add Authentication**
   - OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
   - Role-based access control
   - API key management

2. **Add Database Persistence**
   - PostgreSQL for revocation list
   - Audit log storage
   - Backup and recovery

3. **Enable Monitoring**
   - Prometheus metrics
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Alert configuration

4. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   - Per-user limits
   - Per-endpoint limits
   - DDoS protection

5. **Security Hardening**
   - TLS/HTTPS required
   - Security headers
   - Input validation
   - SQL injection prevention
